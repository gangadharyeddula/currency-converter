A **currency converter using Python** is a simple application that converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time or fixed exchange rates. It typically takes three inputs from the user: the amount, the source currency, and the target currency. Using APIs like **ExchangeRate-API** or **Fixer.io**, the program fetches current exchange rates and calculates the equivalent value. This is commonly built using libraries like `requests` for API access and `tkinter` or `streamlit` for a graphical interface.
